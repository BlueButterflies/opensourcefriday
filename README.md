# Open Source Friday

Open source is made by people just like you. This Friday, invest a few hours contributing to the software you use and love.

## What this is

This repository is the source code for <https://opensourcefriday.com>.

Open Source Friday is a movement to encourage people, companies, and maintainers to contribute a few hours to open source software every Friday.

Open Source Software (OSS) is the backbone of most software, tools, apps, electronics and more that we use every day. Not only is Open Source Friday about encouraging people to contribute, but it's about encouraging businesses to give back to the software they use by setting aside time for our colleagues to work on OSS on the clock.

On the website you'll find a number of guides on getting started with open source and being a good maintainer.
